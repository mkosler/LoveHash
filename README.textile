h2. A simple spatial hash for Love2D projects

This library is designed to help ease the strain on collision calls when
dealing with a large number of objects, i.e. bullets, particles, hordes
of zombies, etc.

*Current Benefits*
* Reduces the time spent checking collisions by reducing the scope of each
object;
* Easy to use;
* Easy to understand.

*To Do*
* Implement better checking for objects near a hash border;
* Implement better checking for objects bigger than the size of the hash
it is in;
* Add the option of using a simple grid or a quadtree.

h3. The demo

Located in the Downloads page is a demo application for the hash. The
"Love2D engine":http://www.love2d.org/ is required to run the demo.

*Keyboard Controls*

* P:	Pauses the demo;
* H:	Toggles the banner showing the timing/hash information.
